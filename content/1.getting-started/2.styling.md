Most of what is on this page is from the [Theming page](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) of [shadcn's](https://ui.shadcn.com/) documentation. I have only made minor changes to the content.

## Convention

> We use a simple background and foreground convention for colors. The background variable is used for the background color of the component and the foreground variable is used for the text color.

## List of variables

Hop on over to this link --> https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming#list-of-variables to see the list of variables that are used in the components.

You will also learn what they are used for.

## Class Variance Authority

Class Variance Authority is used to add different styles to the components based on values passed to different props.

Visit the [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/docs) page to learn more about it.

To get Intellisense for CVA, visit the [CVA Intellisense](https://cva.style/docs/getting-started/installation#intellisense) page.

## Adding your own styles

To add new colors, you need to add them to your CSS file and to your `tailwind.config.ts` file.

```css
:root {
  --warning: 38 92% 50%;
  --warning-foreground: 48 96% 89%;
}

.dark {
  --warning: 48 96% 89%;
  --warning-foreground: 38 92% 50%;
}
```

```ts
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        warning: "hsl(var(--warning))",
        "warning-foreground": "hsl(var(--warning-foreground))",
      },
    },
  },
};
```
