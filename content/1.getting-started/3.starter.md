After cloning the starter template, make sure to remove the `.git` folder and initialize a new git repository.

If you do not want to go through the hassle of setting up a new Nuxt 3 project, you can use the starter template.

Clone the repo from :prose-a[Starter Template]{href="https://github.com/BayBreezy/duxt-starter" target="\_blank"}

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BayBreezy/duxt-starter.git my-project
```
