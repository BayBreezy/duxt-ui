## What is Duxt UI?

First things first, this is :span[NOT]{.text-red-500.font-bold} a component library.

It is a place where you come to get the actual component that you want in your Nuxt 3 project. You can copy & paste the code into your project and customize it to your liking.

## Why Duxt UI?

I have been using Nuxt 3 for a while now and I have found myself re-using a lot of components in my projects. I decided to create this site to make it easier for me to copy & paste the components into my projects.

It is rather annoying to be creating a new TextField component for every project. I know I can just find a repo with the code already & just get it from there but, having a website with all the components I use in one place is much more convenient.

Hop over to the [Introduction page](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) of [shadcn's](https://ui.shadcn.com/) documentation to see some more FAQs.
